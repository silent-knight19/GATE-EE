          <p className="mb-2">
            GATE normalizes raw marks (out of 100) to a score on a scale of 0&ndash;1000 to ensure fairness
            across multiple sessions. The normalization uses the performance of all candidates, the qualifying
            cutoff marks, and the mean/top-scorer marks to calculate your final GATE score.
          </p>
          <p>
            This calculator uses the official GATE normalization formula with historical data to estimate your
            score and corresponding All India Rank across General, OBC, SC/ST, and EWS categories. Use it
            during your mock test practice to set realistic target marks.
